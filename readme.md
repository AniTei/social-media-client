This project is the course assignment for the course Workflow at Noroff, fall 23 and spring 24. 

The project is configured to run Prettier an ESlint on commit.

The code is versioned, and branches have been used.

All known bugs have (not yet) been communicated in the Issues tab.

Tests are written for the project.
These are their workflow status badges:

[![Automated Unit Testing](https://github.com/AniTei/social-media-client/actions/workflows/unit-tests-tir-2355.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AniTei/social-media-client/actions/workflows/unit-tests-tir-2355.yml)

[![Automated E2E Testing](https://github.com/AniTei/social-media-client/actions/workflows/e2e-tests-tir2357.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AniTei/social-media-client/actions/workflows/e2e-tests-tir2357.yml)

OOOps, 3/4 e2e tests are feiling, only the example is passing. Think it is because I still have the local pathway. Have to figure out pages workflow and io. Only 1/3 should fail
