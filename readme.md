unit-tests branch, to do: 
- reread ca wording

The login function (unit) stores a token when provided with valid credentials

it (is provided with valid credentials) expect validation fx > 8 letters
it (stores a token) expect token to be put in local storage?

api? mock? No

Manual testing, able to log in w email and password from JS2, and found token in local storage

Not able to use the mouse though? , used tab??


The logout function (unit) clears the token from browser storage

yes it does, 


It (is told to log out) â€¦ expect token to be cleared from browser?


BOTH UNIT TESTS SHOULD PASS, BC THEY DO WHEN CHECKED MANUALLY


- find relevant functions/files


- create test files
